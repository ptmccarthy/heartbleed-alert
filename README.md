### Heartbleed Alert (Chrome Extension)

This is a quick-and-dirty chrome extension that alerts you if a page you are viewing is vulnerable to the [Heartbleed OpenSSL bug](http://heartbleed.com/).

It uses the vulnerability test created by [Filippo Valsorda](https://github.com/FiloSottile/Heartbleed) hosted on Amazon EC2.
